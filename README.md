### Welcome to My GitHub Portfolio! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Sherry, and I am a third-year student studying Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics at Penn State. I have a couple of repositories dedicated to my web development projects; however, I am looking to expand into more Python and C++ projects. 

Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn!
